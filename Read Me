Program I made a little while ago (around half a year I think?) imported as a java file onto my desktop, along with
a UI (i lost that code tho) so I just have the barebones program. This just asks for a file name, number of copies, 
number of time in seconds, and copies your file after that number of seconds that number of times. If the files doesn't
exist, then it creates the file. It updates the files in real time, so I'm pretty proud of this program.
